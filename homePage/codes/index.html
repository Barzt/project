<!--
  ===== HEAD SECTION =====
  Contains metadata and resources needed before the page loads:
  - UTF-8 charset: Supports Hebrew and international characters
  - viewport meta tag: Critical for responsive design on mobile devices
    * width=device-width tells browser to match screen width
    * initial-scale=1 prevents unwanted zooming on mobile
  - External CSS link: Separates styling from structure (best practice)

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="homePageStyle.css">
</head>

<!--
  ===== BODY CONTAINER =====
  The <body> serves as the main flex container for the entire page layout.
  
  Class: flex-column-container-body
  Purpose: Establishes a vertical flexbox layout that stacks all major sections
  
  Layout flow (top to bottom):
  1. Header  - User links and site logo
  2. Nav     - Main navigation menu
  3. Main    - Primary content area (with potential sidebar)
  4. Footer  - Additional links and info
  
  Why flexbox?
  - Easy vertical stacking with flex-direction: column
  - The main section can use flex: 1 to fill available space
  - Ensures footer stays at bottom even with minimal content
  - Responsive layout changes handled through CSS media queries
  
  CSS to review: display: flex, flex-direction: column, min-height: 100vh
-->

<body class="flex-column-container-body">

  <!--
    ===== HEADER SECTION =====
    Semantic <header> element - tells browsers and screen readers this is the page header
    
    Class: flex-container-header
    Layout: Horizontal flexbox with two main children:
    1. header-links (user greeting/login) - positioned on one side
    2. header-logo (site branding) - positioned on opposite side
    
    Flexbox strategy:
    - justify-content: space-between pushes children to opposite ends
    - align-items: center vertically aligns content in the middle
    - flex-wrap: wrap allows stacking on narrow screens
    
    RTL (Right-to-Left) considerations:
    - header-links uses direction: rtl for proper Hebrew text flow
    - This ensures Hebrew text reads naturally from right to left
    - Padding and spacing adjust accordingly
    
    Accessibility:
    - Semantic <header> tag improves navigation for screen readers
    - Clear separation between user controls and branding
  -->
  <!-- HEADER -->
  <header class="flex-container-header">
    <!-- User interaction links (greeting and login)
         Class: header-links - Flexbox container for horizontal link layout
         - direction: rtl in CSS ensures Hebrew flows naturally
         - gap property creates even spacing between links
         - Links use href="#" as placeholders (will show "not implemented" tooltip on hover)
    -->
    <div class="header-links">
      <a href="#">שלום אורח</a>  <!-- "Hello Guest" -->
      <a href="#">התחבר</a>      <!-- "Log In" -->
    </div>
    <!-- Site logo/brand name
         Class: header-logo - Large, bold text serving as the site identity
         - Text "REMORY" suggests memory/dreams theme (memory + dreams)
         - Large clamp() font size in CSS ensures prominence on all screen sizes
         - Positioned on opposite side from header-links via space-between
    -->
    <div class="header-logo">
      REMORY
    </div>
  </header>

  <!--
    ===== NAVIGATION BAR =====
    Semantic <nav> element - identifies this as the main site navigation
    
    Class: flex-container-nav
    Purpose: Primary navigation menu with main site sections
    
    Layout:
    - Horizontal flexbox layout with centered alignment
    - direction: rtl in CSS for proper Hebrew text ordering
    - flex-wrap allows items to stack on narrow mobile screens
    - gap property provides consistent spacing between links
    
    Visual design:
    - border-bottom creates clear separation from content below
    - All links styled consistently for unified appearance
    - Responsive font sizing with clamp() ensures readability
    
    Accessibility:
    - Semantic <nav> helps screen readers identify navigation
    - Clear, descriptive link text (in Hebrew)
    - Keyboard navigation supported through standard link behavior
  -->
  <!-- NAV -->
  <nav class="flex-container-nav">
    <a href="#">דף הבית</a>            <!-- "Home" - Returns to main page -->
    <a href="#">שחזור חלום</a>          <!-- "Restore/Recall a Dream" - Dream recovery feature -->
    <a href="#">החלומות שלי</a>         <!-- "My Dreams" - User's dream collection -->
    <a href="#">דפוסי חלום</a>          <!-- "Dream Patterns" - Analysis of recurring themes -->
    <a href="#">על חלומות וזיכרון</a>   <!-- "About Dreams and Memory" - Educational content -->
  </nav>

  <!--
    ===== MAIN + ASIDE WRAPPER =====
    Container that can hold both main content and an optional sidebar (aside)
    
    Class: flex-containr-main-and-aside-plus-stretch
    NOTE: There's a typo in the class name - "containr" should be "container"
          This typo exists in both HTML and CSS, so the styling still works
          In production, this should be corrected in both files simultaneously
    
    Layout strategy:
    - Horizontal flexbox creates side-by-side layout (main content | sidebar)
    - flex: 1 allows this container to grow and fill available vertical space
    - This pushes the footer to the bottom of the page
    - gap: 2% creates breathing room between main and sidebar sections
    
    Responsive behavior:
    - On mobile (max-width: 750px), switches to flex-direction: column
    - Sidebar stacks below main content for better mobile UX
    - Currently only contains <main>, but structure supports adding <aside> later
  -->

  <div class="flex-containr-main-and-aside-plus-stretch">

    <!--
      ===== MAIN CONTENT AREA =====
      Semantic <main> element - identifies the primary content of the page
      
      Class: flex-container-main-plus-stretch
      Purpose: Houses the core page content (banner, offer cards, etc.)
      
      Layout:
      - Itself a flexbox container, allowing for side-by-side sections inside
      - flex: 1 makes it grow to fill available horizontal space
      - Can accommodate left/right decorative images or additional columns
      - min-width: 0 prevents overflow issues with images or wide content
      
      Current structure:
      Contains one main section (flex-column-container-sections-plus-stretch)
      which holds the banner and offer grid
      
      Desktop vs Mobile:
      - Desktop: Can display multiple columns side by side
      - Mobile: Switches to column layout, stacking sections vertically
      
      Why semantic <main>?
      - Only one <main> per page - identifies the primary content
      - Improves accessibility for screen reader users
      - Helps search engines understand page structure
    -->
    <!-- MAIN LAYOUT -->
    <main class="flex-container-main-plus-stretch">

        <!-- OPTIONAL: Decorative side image area
             Currently commented out, but shows planning for future enhancement
             Could be used for:
             - Decorative left/right borders
             - Seasonal imagery
             - Animated elements (note the .gif extension)
             If activated, would sit beside the main content section via flexbox
        -->

        <figure class=> <img src="lside.gif"></figure>
        -->


        <!--
          ===== CENTER CONTENT COLUMN =====
          Main content section containing banner and offer cards
          
          Class: flex-column-container-sections-plus-stretch
          Layout: Vertical flexbox (column) stacking content top to bottom
          
          Structure:
          1. Top section: Logo/banner (container-section-blue)
          2. Main section: Grid of clickable offer cards
          
          Design:
          - flex: 1 allows this section to grow and fill available space
          - Light gray background (#e9e9e9) creates subtle visual separation
          - gap property provides consistent spacing between banner and cards
          - padding creates internal breathing room
          
          Why <section>?
          - Groups related content thematically
          - More specific than generic <div>
          - Better for document outline and accessibility
        -->
        <!-- CENTER CONTENT -->
        <section class="flex-column-container-sections-plus-stretch">

        <!--
          ===== BANNER / LOGO SECTION =====
          Prominent visual header showcasing the site logo
          
          Class: container-section-blue
          Purpose: Brand identity and visual appeal
          
          Design features:
          - aspect-ratio: 16/6 maintains consistent proportions
          - max-height: 22vh limits vertical space (responsive to viewport)
          - Flexbox centering positions logo nicely within the space
          - Rounded corners (border-radius) for modern aesthetic
          - overflow: hidden keeps image within rounded boundaries
          
          Image handling:
          - object-fit: contain preserves logo proportions without distortion
          - Border creates clear frame around logo
          - Relative path ../images/ indicates organized folder structure
          
          Accessibility:
          - alt text "our logo" provides context for screen readers
          - Could be more descriptive: "Remory - Dreams and Memory site logo"
        -->
          <!-- TOP STRIP -->
          <section class="container-section-blue">
            <img src="../images/remoryLogo1.jpg" alt="our logo">

          <!--
            ===== OFFERS GRID =====
            Grid of clickable cards leading to different site sections
            
            Class: flex-wrap-container-offers-sections
            Structure: Vertical flexbox containing rows of cards
            
            Organization:
            - Outer container: flex-column stacks rows vertically
            - Each row (flex-container-offer-section): holds 2 cards side by side
            - Individual cards (container-artice): clickable image+text combinations
            
            NOTE: "container-artice" appears to be a typo for "container-article"
                  The class works because it's consistent in both HTML and CSS
                  Should be corrected in production code
            
            Card layout strategy:
            - Desktop: 2x2 grid (2 cards per row, 2 rows)
            - Mobile: 1x4 stack (cards stack vertically via flex-direction: column)
            - Each card uses <article> semantic element (self-contained content)
            
            User experience:
            - Large click targets for easy interaction
            - Descriptive images with text overlay
            - Hover effects provide visual feedback
          -->

                 Class: flex-container-offer-section
                 - flex-direction: row-reverse for RTL layout
                 - gap: 2% creates space between the two cards
                 - Switches to column on mobile for stacking
            -->

                   Styling:
                   - position: relative on article allows absolute positioning of children
                   - Image: position absolute with inset: 0 fills entire card
                   - Link: position relative with higher z-index appears on top
                   - Text shadow ensures readability over any background
                   
                   Accessibility:
                   - alt text describes image content in Hebrew
                   - Link text clearly describes action: "Restore your dream"

  <!--
    ===== FOOTER SECTION =====
    Semantic <footer> element - identifies this as page footer/metadata area
    
    Class: flex-container-footer
    Purpose: Contains secondary navigation and legal/info links
    
    Layout:
    - Horizontal flexbox with centered content
    - direction: rtl for Hebrew text flow
    - border-top creates visual separation from main content
    - flex-wrap allows links to stack on very narrow screens
    
    Typical footer content:
    - About us / Company info
    - Legal documents (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy)
    - Contact information
    - Social media links
    - Copyright notice
    
    Why semantic <footer>?
    - Tells browsers and screen readers this is supplementary info
    - Can appear at end of any sectioning content, not just <body>
    - Improves document structure and accessibility
    
    Current links:
    - All use href="#" placeholders (will show tooltip on hover)
    - Ready to be connected to actual pages when developed

  ===== OVERALL STRUCTURE SUMMARY =====
  This HTML document demonstrates:
  
  1. Semantic HTML5: Using appropriate tags (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <footer>)
     Benefits: Better accessibility, SEO, and code maintainability
  
  2. Flexbox-based layout: Modern CSS layout without floats or positioning hacks
     Benefits: Responsive, flexible, and easy to modify
  
  3. RTL support: Proper handling of Hebrew text with direction: rtl
     Benefits: Natural reading experience for Hebrew users
  
  4. Responsive design: Mobile-first approach with media queries
     Benefits: Works well on all screen sizes
  
  5. Accessibility considerations:
     - Semantic elements for screen readers
     - Alt text on images
     - Clear heading hierarchy (should add <h1>, <h2> tags in production)
     - Descriptive link text
  
  6. Organized file structure:
     - Separate CSS file (homePageStyle.css)
     - Images in organized folder (../images/)
     - Clean, commented code
  
  Areas for enhancement:
  - Fix typos: "containr" → "container", "artice" → "article"
  - Add more descriptive alt text
  - Include heading tags (<h1>, <h2>) for better structure
  - Implement actual page links (replace href="#")
  - Add meta description for SEO
  - Consider adding <title> variation per page
